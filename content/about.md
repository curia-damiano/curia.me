## Hi, I'm Damiano Curia

Welcome to my corner of the internet! This is where I share my thoughts, experiences, and learnings about technology and software development.

### What I Do

I'm passionate about:

- Building reliable and scalable software systems
- Exploring new technologies and frameworks
- Sharing knowledge with the developer community
- Continuous learning and improvement

### This Blog

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator, and hosted on GitHub Pages. I develop it using Visual Studio Code with Dev Containers to ensure a consistent development environment.

The goal of this blog is to document my journey, share useful insights, and contribute to the broader tech community.
